We've explored lot of options for selling courses and webinars. Most are proprietory like Kajabi, Podia, Teachable etc. But all of them had limited customization options, and thats why we started building Torqbit, to create a quality open source alternative to all of these platforms.

‚ö†Ô∏è Torqbit is currently under active development. Expect a series of updates in the coming weeks.

## üçô Self Hosting

### Prerequisite

Development system must have docker engine installed and running.

### Steps

Setting up local environment is extremely easy and straight forward. Follow the below step and you will be ready to contribute

1. Clone the code locally using `git clone https://github.com/torqbit/torqbit`
1. Switch to the code folder `cd torqbit`
1. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to include the Google & Github client credentials, and the email id that will be the admin for the platform.
1. Now run the command `docker-compose up` to launch the web app and the MySQL server.

You are ready to play around the platform. Do not forget to refresh the browser (in case id does not auto-reload)

Thats it!
